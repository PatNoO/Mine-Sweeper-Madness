## üéØ Purpose

The purpose of this project was to develop a fully playable version of the classic **Minesweeper** game, based on our initial design idea and plan.  
Throughout the project, we focused on applying **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, writing **clean and structured code**,
and creating a **colorful and engaging** player experience.

In addition to the technical work, the project emphasized **collaboration using Git**.  
Each group member worked in separate **branches**, regularly merging updates through **pull requests**,
to ensure a clear and professional workflow.
